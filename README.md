Day 1 focuses on introducing the Gemini API and provides examples of prompting. Key takeaways include:

*   Exploring TextFX, SQL Talk, and NotebookLM.
*   Reading the “[Introduction to Prompting](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting-intro)” from the Gemini API docs.
*   Trying out prompts in AI Studio using the Gemini API’s [prompt gallery](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/prompts).
*   Consulting the Gemini API cookbook for inspirational examples and educational quickstarts: [https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook](https://github.com/google-gemini/cookbook)

The primary goal was to understand the core functionalities and potential of the Gemini family of models.

We started by reviewing the introductory documentation on prompting, specifically the “[Introduction to Prompting](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/prompting-intro)” guide. This provided a foundational understanding of how to craft effective prompts for optimal results.

The core activity involved utilizing AI Studio to test various prompts. We explored the prompt gallery, attempting different prompts to see how the models responded. We experimented with different prompt styles, including asking for creative writing, data extraction, and code generation. 

Furthermore, we delved into the Gemini Cookbook, a collection of inspirational examples and quickstarts, to gain a deeper understanding of the API’s capabilities and explore more complex use cases. The aim was to build a solid base of knowledge and practical experience with the Gemini API before moving on to more advanced tasks.
